# Car Acceleration Computation

This project computes the acceleration of multiple cars using a Y by 3 matrix, where Y is the number of cars. The program uses C and x86-64 assembly language with SIMD instructions to perform calculations. The assembly function is responsible for calculating acceleration and converting data types.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler**: GCC (or compatible)
- **Assembler**: NASM
- **Operating System**: Windows or Linux (tested on Windows)
- **Basic Knowledge of Command-Line Operations**: For running the batch file and compiling code

## Steps to Compile and Run

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/acceleration-computation.git
cd acceleration-computation
